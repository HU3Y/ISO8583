# Adelbs-ISO8583
This is a gui tool for testing ISO8583 protocol (requests and responses), and a java library as well.
Through this tool you can:
* Configure the ISO8583 structure in both: visual (UI) or a very simple XML file;
* Invoke a ISO8583 service, sending a message according to the XML configuration file described above;
* Receive a ISO8583 message from a external service;
* Parse and analise messages.

It is under development (not released yet). You can see the development backlog here. Feel free to fork it or sugest anything.

I intend to write a wiki explaining how to use it. For while, an example of the XML configuration file and some screenshots:
