# Adelbs-ISO8583
This is a gui tool for testing ISO8583 protocol (requests and responses), and a java library as well.
Through this tool you can:
* Configure the ISO8583 structure in both: visual (UI) or a very simple XML file;
* Invoke a ISO8583 service, sending a message according to the XML configuration file described above;
* Receive a ISO8583 message from a external service;
* Parse and analise messages.

The messages can be at many encoding formats, inclusive mainframe EBCDIC.

It is under development (not released yet), so you may find some UI bugs. If so, please, fell free to open new issues. Feel free to fork it or sugest anything. Please, any comments or suggestions, contact me. I'll be happy to know if this is helping someone somehow.... :)

I intend to write a wiki explaining how to use it. For while, an example of the XML configuration file and some screenshots:
